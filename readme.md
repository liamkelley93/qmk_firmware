# Quantum Mechanical Keyboard Firmware

## This is a fork of a fork of the Massdrop fork of QMK (yes, a fork<sup>3</sup>)
Forked from pleasuretek, who added:
* Added glitter/cloud effect
* Customized my personal keymap
* Functionality for a 'game mode' led map. The 'game mode' for leds keeps the key layout the same but can change RGB layouts with a keycode.

Modified by yours truly for specific color combos, game mode lighting, etc. for the Ctrl. Version for the Alt in progress.
